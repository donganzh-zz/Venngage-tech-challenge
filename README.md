# React Drag and Alignment Demo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### 1. `yarn install`

Install required dependencies for this project.

### 2. `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Then you can play around with the drag and alignment feature

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### TODO

I tried to add a resize feature to the component, but in one mouseclick event, it cannot do two action, both drag and resize. I think this can be fixed by using react state.
